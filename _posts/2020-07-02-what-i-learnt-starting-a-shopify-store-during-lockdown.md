For most of my working life, I’ve been involved in side projects, otherwise known as side hustles in millennial speak.

Thus, with the current work from home (WFH) situation, I felt it’d be a good time to start a shopify store from scratch. Here’xs what I learnt in the process:

### Your product must have demand 

Sounds simple, but often missed out in the excitement of choosing a product/niche that you (not your audience) likes.

Having a product with demand is fundamental because when you’re on a tight budget, it will _keep your cost per acquisition (CPA) low. By keeping CPA low_, you can roll your profits (revenue - cogs - cpa) back into your business - more ads, improving your product, packaging, better shipping experience etc.

How do you go about doing this? Here are some product research tips that helped me get started:

#### 1: Find bestsellers on e-commerce sites

Find the top e-commerce sites in your location and stalk them for what’s popular. An example below is from aliexpress - you’d want to **sort it by orders and filter for those with good reviews**.

If the e-commerce site in your region does not have filter functionalities, look at what the site is pushing on the home page or any top category/bestseller sections, usually e-commerce sites will use this to highlight their best products.

#### 2: Use Google’s free (woohoo) tools to do keyword research

Hook yourself up with Google Adwords and use their [free keyword tool](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_sg/home/tools/keyword-planner/). From there, you can compare average monthly search volumes to get a sense of how interested people are in your product vs other potential products/niches. 

You can also review the competition from other advertisers for your product, usually high competition is a sign advertisers can get a return from selling them. Here’s how it looks like on the console:

Additionally, you can use [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) to assess whether your product is on an uptrend or downtrend. Trends are useful to help tell if your product is seasonal and whether it is gaining interest over time. 

The below screenshot, for example, tells you that i) airpods have more inherent interest than neck massagers and ii) they trend highest during launch - which you could possibly tap on for the release of their next version.

#### 3: Stalk your competition

If you follow steps 1 and 2, then you’ll have a product that has some degree of competition - people are quick to take advantage of trending products. 

Hence, you’ll want to check out their web properties to give you a better idea of whether it’s worth competing with them. There are several tools here at your disposal.

1. Instagram search: **Look up your top competitors’ instagram handles by searching for the product you intend to sell** - for example, if you search for ‘airpods’ on instagram’s search bar, it should point you to the top few biggest handles for that product. Looking at these handles can tell you a few things about stocking the product:
- What’s your competiton’s unique selling proposition, can you differentiate yourself from them?
- How are their followers engaging with their handle, what strategies do they employ (i.e. giveaways) to get engagement? Will you be able to replicate those strategies?
- How big is their follower base? This will let you know if you could use social media to distribute your product.

2. [Facebook Ads Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=SG&impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime): **Looking at what kinds of ads your competitors run on Facebook/Instagram** will help you answer the following questions about your product or niche.
- Does Facebook/Instagram advertising work for your niche?
- Do your competitors seem to be spending a lot on advertising? This will give clues on what channels are working for them, and whether you’ll have to invest money or manpower on Facebook/Instagram ads.
- What kinds of messaging are they reaching out to their cold audiences with? Again, can you differentiate here?

3. Using [similarweb](https://www.similarweb.com/), you can **check out what channels drive traffic to your competitors’ website**. This will help you establish potential channels you can tap on for your own website. To substantiate this, you can also go to their website itself and look out for:
- What kinds of products are they stocking up on? Which are their bestsellers?
- What prices are they selling at?
- The type of messaging they have on high traffic pages like their homepage?

Great! Now that you have data that substantiates your choice of product (and not just a hunch!), you can look at your pricing strategy.

### Pricing matters...a lot

Usually, coming from a performance marketing background means I tend to think of optimising  channels like facebook/google ads to grow the business. 

However, the experience of starting an ecommerce store has taught me that pricing is an extremely important step to **get right before spending time and effort on your various channels.**

The graph below depicts the impact that a change in price had for my store. Essentially, it was a 2275% increase to the business’s weekly transaction volume with a 33% decrease in price.

Now, I won’t say I’m a pricing expert, but I do know that pricing is definitely something worth testing and thinking about, so how do you actually go about it?

1. Pre post test: Chances are, you are the site or business owner, so make small adjustments and compare the differences in data when you make a price change. One tip will be to make [annotations](https://www.lovesdata.com/blog/google-analytics-annotations) on Google Analytics - this will help you remember the pricing changes you make.

2. Research competition prices: Find out what prices they use and their position in the market. For example, the competitor with the most instagram followers is likely the market leader, this will mean they can charge higher than you. 

   Do you then want to make your price the exact same as them? Usually, this will mean you will lose out some volume as people may not feel you are worth as much as the market leader. So, a wise move may be to instead, price lower initially to incentivise customers to try your store out.

3. Do some initial surveys to your first few customers? [Sean Ellis](https://www.seanellis.me/) wrote a fantastic book called hacking growth where he lists some survey questions you can ask to get more insights into pricing. I won’t go into great detail, but here are some templates provide in the book:
- At what price point does your product become too expensive the you won’t consider buying it?
- At what price point does your product start to become expensive, but you still will consider buying it?
- At what price point does your product start to become a really good deal?
- At what price point does your product become too cheap such that you question its quality? 

With proper product and pricing in place, that leaves you with getting your product into the right audiences. Which brings us to the final learning I had.

### Finding your best channel early on is key to get traction  

You would think that with experience handling 7-figure marketing budgets in Facebook/Instagram, that I could easily replicate the same thing for my store.

Unfortunately, this wasn’t the case right away. My nascent design and video editing skills made it difficult to get creatives to perform on Facebook. Whilst I am still working on developing these skills (I highly recommend [canva’s design school](https://designschool.canva.com/) for those interested as well), I still needed to make money! 

Thankfully, search engine marketing (SEM) has been delivering a pretty decent and steady return on ad spend for my store. Hence, most of the budget and effort has gone to getting this set up.

I also invested in optimising for search engine optimisation (SEO) as well, since SEM was converting well, getting those same searches to appear for free became a priority.

The key thing to take from this is that what your competition or people tell you are working is not a given. You have to **test it out for yourself**. If I had been persistent and spent the majority of marketing budget on more popular Facebook/Instagram ads, I wouldn't be in a profitable position and be able to make the kinds of changes to product or pricing that I can afford now.

Luckily, it’s quite easy to get an idea of which channels are worth investing in.  

To start, you’ll need to connect shopify to google analytics, the full instructions of which can be found [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/google-analytics/google-analytics-setup).

Once done, you’d then want to look at your channel report (screenshot below) to see where most of your traffic and transactions are coming from.

![google analytics example]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/jerry_openshopify4.jpeg "google analytics example")

Finally, you’d want to tie in how much you’re spending on any paid channels and ask yourself: 
- Is the quality you are getting from that channel of good quality? The metric to look at would be bounce rate (higher is worse).
- Is the channel bringing you a decent return? Look at revenue from that channel and divide it by your spend to get your return on advertising spend (ROAS). At the very least, your ROAS should be higher than your cost of goods sold (shipping plus any costs to middlemen payments or suppliers)
- What is your conversion rate for that particular channel?

With those tips, you’d then be able to discern which is your most important channel, and to subsequently focus your time and money on it!

### Are you thinking of setting up your own ecommerce store?

Voila! There you have it, some of my personal learnings from starting my own shopify store. To round up, here are some summarised pros and cons if you are thinking of taking the leap too.

**Pros**
- You’ll usually get to learn more compared to what you learn in a job, because companies usually have more specialised roles. Thus, if you are looking to learn non marketing functions like pricing or supply chain for example, then this will be a good learning experience.
- This learning experience and the store itself can be used in your resume. If you take the time to build something, it is a sign that you are hungry to learn and have ambition.
- If you are in marketing, it will give you a renewed sense of hustle. Trust me, when you spend your own money, it’s a different feeling altogether. It will help you appreciate every dollar that you spend in your day job if you are in a field like performance marketing. Also, it gives you a greater appreciation for affinity functions in your day job (in my case, I really miss my design and creative team!)

**Cons**
- Foregoing traditional leisure hours. Instead of Netflix or gaming, you will find yourself sitting in front of the shopify console and planning your next move. Thus, the best way around this is to enjoy the learning process, because you will definitely burn out if you don’t consider the whole experience as downtime.
- You have to put up some costs - these include costs on advertising, shipping, inventory. If you are in debt, I strongly recommend you waiting till you settle that first before taking the plunge.

I’m going to round up by saying that your day job comes first and foremost - and that you should only attempt a side hustle if you are not bogged down at work. This is because the upside is almost definitely not going to exceed your stable income at work, at least initially. 

Nope, not going to do a fake internet guru pitch here and say that you can quit your job once you start ;).

Instead, I think this should be treated like extra curricular activity that hones your business acumen in your day job. Having that kind of mentality will keep you going when times are rough, ensure you prioritise learning in your career, and actually improve your performance in your real job.
