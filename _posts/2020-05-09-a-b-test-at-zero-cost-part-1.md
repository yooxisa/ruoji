While running A/B tests can sound exciting, the execution and planning of it can be chaotic, especially with a small team. We are sharing our attempt of organizing effective A/B tests, and hopefully at the end of the post, you can draw some inspiration for yours.

We have been using following 5 steps to run a successful A/B test our campaigns:

### Build a Prioritization Framework

A prioritization framework is essential for everyone to enter ideas and rank their ideas. It can be as simple as creating a spreadsheet to track all ideas with structured inputs from contributors. We were inspired by the book “Hacking Growth: How Today’s Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success” by Sean Ellis (Available on Amazon: [HERE](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X)).

#### 1. Number it  

#JustHousekeepingThings Make sure everything is organized for documentation memos!

#### 2. Objective
    
> What do you want to achieve, e.g. improve add-to-cart rate?

Try to break down a big KPI into mutually exclusive smaller goals. At any one point of time, you are improving one part of the funnel instead of all. For example, we cannot improve conversion rate directly but we can improve one part of the funnel leading up to conversion rate so that the overall conversion rate is improved

> Each rectangular represents one part of the funnel leading up to Conversion Rate (CR)

#### 3. Hypothesis

> by doing X action, I predict add-to-cart rate will be improved by 20%  


We usually conduct a quick analysis of the metrics to date and estimate number of users affected by this hypothesis; we also plot out the historical trends of those metrics to extract user behaviours to predict the improvement with the test

It’s dangerous to start a test without understanding the impact, e.g. you may propose a test for 1 user instead of 1000 users

#### 4. Target Audience

Is this an experiment for all visitors, new visitors or a segment of users?

#### 5. Key results to track

PICK 1 PRIMARY GOAL!

There is a misconception: trying to test as much as possible from one test so we get more learnings. This isn’t wrong and you can still set up secondary goals for an experiment. However, if the primary goal isn’t clear, when you review the experiment design you’ll be lost and miss the original objective.

### Prioritize It

Each point has a rating from 1 to 5 and the tests scoring the highest average will be prioritized.

### Choose an A/B Testing Tool and Create a Test

There are a number of tools in the market but we’ve been on Google Optimize for several reasons:

* It’s FREE and directly linked to Google Analytics to track results, create goals and segmentations based on your historical data

* It can be easily implemented via GTM or a line of simple code

* You can easily modify anything on a specific page (you name it) via simple HTML/CSS; if you want to go hardcore, there is the JS option too

* It takes care of all statistical calculations and show you the significance of the results

Limitations:  

* Max 5 tests are running concurrently but we’re unlikely to exceed that  

* 1 primary goal in every test, which is great because it helps us to be laser-focus and overly greedy; however, you can have multiple secondary goals

### Run It

This is the simplest step out of all 5, because you just gotta wait.

### Document It
Each time a test is selected, a 1–2 page memo should be created according to the following template. The memo will help document the expected results and conclusions from the experiment.
