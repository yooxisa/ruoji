While running A/B tests can sound exciting, the execution and planning of it can be chaotic, especially with a small team. Given the 10,000 other immediate priorities we might have on our plate, we often ponder on whether these tests might create any value.

### Before we start ‚Äî Some hard truths upfront on A/B tests:

**Guess what? Running A/B tests can be useless at times** üò™

* Time-consuming: 2 weeks are typically needed for one of the variants to be statistically significant during testing
* Lack of actionable next steps: Test results can be counter-intuitive and inconsistent; you have either test again at another time or leave it for now after a month of testing

With this, we recommend [a bunch of articles from CXL](https://cxl.com/?s=test) for further reading. **So why are we still running these tests?**

* Validation: It is human nature to make assumptions based on instincts, but the reality might be quite contradictory. Testing is the best way to put things into perspective and leverage data to validate assumptions. Removing guesswork out of the picture, why not?

* As the saying goes, ‚Äúsmall tweaks can move the needle‚Äù: We recently conducted a test: by placing an urgency label ‚Äúselling fast‚Äù on popular products; we saw a 20% higher add-to-cart rate compared to the original version.

* Team work: it helps bring minds together to explore something out of the norm. If you work in a fast-paced startup environment, there is no doubt that your team has tons of daily work to execute. To alleviate them of their daily grind, create something different and exciting for them to participate in. You might be surprised by the creativity and novel ideas!
